INTRODUCTION

What is Personalized Marketing?
Marketing personalization, also known as personalized marketing or one-to-one marketing, is the practice of using data to deliver brand messages targeted to an individual prospect. This method differs from traditional marketing, which mostly relied on casting a wide net to earn a small number of customers. With billboards, cold calls, mailings, and more, traditional marketing emphasized the quantity of messages over their relevance. Later, analytics became more sophisticated and data on individual prospects grew. Today, marketers take advantage of both to deliver prospects the most relevant message at the ideal time. Personalization has changed marketing from the bottom up, improving the customer experience, and, in turn, making businesses more profitable.

AI and Personalized Marketing:
Customer Data is collected using automated tools and smart algorithms, which is where machine learning comes in. Typically, a code is added to the website, enabling the machine to capture valuable data such as clicks, time spent on site, and purchase history. With the right technology, you can also collect data from customer interactions across multiple channels.
Data collection also includes gathering information on customer demographics, such as age, gender, location, and financial status. Once you’ve collected all the relevant data, the algorithms will analyse it and identify which customers should receive which content. 

MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT:
Personalized marketing has several benefits, for both businesses and consumers. It improves customer experience by maintaining consistency and cohesion on all channels, leading to stronger brand loyalty and, ultimately, increased revenue.
Today, personalization is more important than ever, as consumers have access to content from several channels. Sometimes, users feel overloaded with information and won’t bother to give it full attention. However, when people see their own name, this personalized content can capture their interest. Personalized content is effective because it speaks directly to your consumer.
The reason we chose this project is because, marketing is an eclectic field with a dynamic nature. Personalized marketing blends creativity with AI, making use of user purchase history statistics as well as product sale trends.

OUTCOMES:
The personalized marketing system can lead to a variety of outcomes including increased engagement, improved   
customer satisfaction, better retention, increased revenue and stronger relationships with customers.
